# ðŸ“‡ Business Card Project â€“ Scrimba

This project was part of a [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) Frontend Developer course.  
The original version was built following the tutorial, but at the end, I customized it to match my own style.  
I also added some extra features and design tweaks that go beyond the scope of the lesson.

It's one of my first solo projects and an early step on my journey into web development using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.


# Getting Started
